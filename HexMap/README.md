This package contains a simple hex tile in [Scenes3d/World.tscn](Scenes3d/World.tscn). By interacting with the placeholder entities around the hex tile, additional hex tiles are placed at that location and the placeholder is removed. In the logs, clicking on a hex tile reveals the position of the selected hex, and clicking on a placeholder tile also reveals the position of the placeholder as it is removed.

Due to the nature of this project, simply copy and pasting may not work.
Tested in Godot v4.4.1.
